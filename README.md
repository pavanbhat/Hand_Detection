# Hand_Detection 


A real-time hand detection and tracking system created using controlled environments(i.e. by recording a video) where the background of an input needs to be plain. 

The concepts used in order to perform Hand Detection are as follows:
1. Hand Segmentation using CIELAB color space
2. Median Filtering
3. Morphology (Opening in particular)
4. Harris corners
5. Centroid
6. Delauney Triangulation
7. Convex Hull Algorithm
